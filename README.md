# Info

This web app allows you to search for the weather of cities around the world and save cities as favourites.

I used the free OpenWeatherMap APIs: https://openweathermap.org/api

The site has no commercial purpose, you can view it at the following link:
https://sz-weather.netlify.app/

For the project I used React + Vue and Netlify Function serverless. So if you want to download it, to use it you have to run the following commands:

npm install

Create a file .env and add VITE_API_KEY = your_api_key
You can create a key here: https://openweathermap.org/api

netlify dev
