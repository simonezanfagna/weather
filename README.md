# Info

This web app allows you to search for the weather of cities around the world and save cities as favourites.

I used the free OpenWeatherMap APIs: https://openweathermap.org/api

The site has no commercial purpose, you can view it at the following link:

For the project I used React + Vue. So if you want to download it, to use it you have to run the following commands:

npm install

In the weatherSlice.js file, replace API_KEY_OPENWEATHERMAP with your own key that you can create here: https://openweathermap.org/api

npm run dev
